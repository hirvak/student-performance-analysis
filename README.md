🎓 Student Performance Analysis System

A **Python-based data analysis and visualization project** that cleans, analyzes, and presents student performance data through an **interactive Streamlit web application**.


🧩 Problem Statement

Educational datasets often contain **missing values and duplicate records**, making analysis inaccurate.
This project solves that by:

* Cleaning raw student data
* Performing statistical analysis
* Presenting insights through a user-friendly web interface

 ⚙️ Tech Stack

* **Python**
* **Pandas** – data cleaning & analysis
* **NumPy** – numerical operations
* **Streamlit** – interactive UI & deployment
* **GitHub** – version control

 🚀 Key Features

* **Data Cleaning**

  * Handled missing values using statistical imputation
  * Removed duplicate records
  * Generated derived columns (Total Marks)

* **Data Analysis**

  * Subject-wise performance metrics (average, max, min)
  * Class performance comparison (above/below average)
  * Automatic student ranking based on total marks

* **Interactive Dashboard**

  * View all student records
  * Identify class topper
  * Subject-wise analysis
  * Student-wise result using Roll Number input

 📊 Project Highlights (Resume Worthy)

* Designed a **complete data analysis pipeline** from raw CSV to deployment
* Implemented **real-world data preprocessing techniques**
* Built an **interactive analytical dashboard**
* Deployed the application using **Streamlit Cloud**
* Followed **clean code and modular design principles**
